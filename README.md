# Shell scripting for font builds that are approachable, scalable, and repeatable

[A presentation for TypeLab 2021](https://2021.typographics.com/typelab#1188).

A quick demo showing how shell scripts can help you make font build pipelines that are easy to set up, easy to extend, and stable over the long term. What are shell scripts, anyway? Anything you can run in the terminal (and this is more than you might think), you can write in a shell script to run again later. These scripts can sequence multiple command-line tools and Python scripts, name and organize files, and more. This allows you to set up some powerful but simple workflows â€“ all without having to remember any special options in the terminal.
